## Adventurer Subclasses

### Kid in the Corner
+ Starts with 25 HP.
+ He attacks with his silence(2 DMG). For every time he attacks, he writes down the name of the one being attacked in his Death Note. Once the number of times reach a certain number, he automatically unleashes his special attack.
+ His special attack is him pulling out his hidden AK47 from his backpack and attacking all enemies(10 DMG/enemy).
+ He supports himself through pulling up his hood and erasing himself from other's perception. In this status, he's untargetable. Last one round.
+ When he supports others, he deals 2 DMG to the target because he can not support others.
